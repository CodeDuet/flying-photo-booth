VERSION 1.0

Need a photo booth at your event? There is an app for that!

Party PhotoBooth is optimized for weddings, birthday parties, and any events where your guests are encouraged to act goofy on camera. As the host, you will be able to get your photo booth up and running in a minute. You can link your Facebook and Dropbox accounts to have photo strips of your guests automatically shared, privately or publicly.

The app includes party features like keeping itself in the foreground, so the device will remain as a photo booth for the duration of the event. You can even have guests pass the device around as a mobile photo booth, not having to worry about the app being closed.

I understand if you are to use Party PhotoBooth at your wedding, the app must work flawlessly. Party PhotoBooth is based on the same engine that drives the Flying PhotoBooth, which has been in market for a while with great reviews. I would recommend trying that out as a demo: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.groundupworks.flyingphotobooth
