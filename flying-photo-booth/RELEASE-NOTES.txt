INTERVIEW WITH MYSELF

Me: How is Flying Photobooth different from other photo booth apps or photo strip creation tools?

Myself: My goal is to help you put together and share a photo strip in the least amount of time possible, hence the "Flying" before the Photobooth. This is achieved through a minimal and responsive UI, and a streamlined work flow that includes: CAPTURE, REVIEW, SAVE and SHARE. While most photo strip apps focus on photo editing capabilities, I spend my time polishing this work flow to get you through with the fewest clicks in the shortest time, as well as adding sharing options so you never have to open another app just to distribute your photo strip.

Me: What are some cool features?

Myself: The swipe-to-retake feature is a unique picture review process that fits really well into the work flow. Android Beam support is another unique feature among photo apps. I initially added the functionality for fun, but it turns out to be a very convenient way to share. You can beam a photo strip to your friend's device in a single click even while without a network connection!

Me: Will your app work on my device?

Myself: Yes. As long as your phone or tablet has a camera, this photo booth will make photo strips and it will not crash or "force close". The app is very stable across devices. If you have read this far, you may as well give it a try?

Me: Well, is it free?

Myself: Absolutely, and also free of ads.

This is achieved through a minimal and responsive UI, and a streamlined work flow that includes: capture, review, save and share.
